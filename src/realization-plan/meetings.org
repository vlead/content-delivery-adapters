** From Thirumal [2017-09-20 Wed]
  1. Arghya will make a pull request to vlead-onboarding
     containing the automation for setting up the VLEAD
     development environment.
  2. All the earlier minutes of meetings and discussions are
     to be imported from SSAD repo to align with the
     [[https://github.com/vlead/2017-monsoon-ssad-projects/blob/master/src/guidelines.org#things-done-at-the-weekly-meeting][guidelines]]. You should have a plan.org with the
     tabulated issues. 
  3. Pull request review
     1. Make changes in develop or other branches on the
        forked repo.
     2. Make a pull request to the develop branch of the
        blessed repo.
  4. [[https://github.com/vlead/vlead-onboarding/blob/master/src/set-up-vlead-openedx-vagrant-box.org][Install]] Open edX vagrant box.
  5. [[https://github.com/vlead/setup-ovpl-centos/blob/develop/user-docs/run-ads-using-vagrant-box.org][Install]] ADS service as a vagrant box.
  6. Make all the services - translators,
     resource-generator, content-server auto deployable.
     Refer [[https://github.com/vlead/ovpl/blob/master/docs/understanding-labspec.org][documentation]] in developing the deployment
     specification.  Also refer [[https://github.com/vlead/lab-data-service][lds]] which is already auto
     deployed.  Create a folder =scripts= and put the
     deployment specification in this folder.  Please follow
     the same naming conventions as in [[https://github.com/vlead/lab-data-service][lds]].  Refer [[http://dev.vlabs.ac.in/labs/lab-structure.html][here]] to
     understand the structure.  Refer [[https://github.com/vlead/outreach-portal/blob/master/scripts/start][outreach-portal]] for
     defining start and stop scripts.
  7. By next week, there should be a demonstration of the
     creation of the experiment from developer's machine.
